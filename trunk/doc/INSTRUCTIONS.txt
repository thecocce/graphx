Here are some quick instructions to get you started

1. In order to test Graphx, make sure you have the following installed:

- haXe : http://haxe.org/download
- Graphviz : http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php

2. Make sure the dot executable (which comes with Graphviz) is in your path.

3. Place any Graphviz files (*.gv) you want to test in the tpl folder
(why not take some from the Graphviz gallery page: http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php)

4. From the commandline, navigate to the build folder and run:
"haxe Convert.hxml"
If you are on Windows, you should just be able to double-click the hxml file

5. Navigate to the bin folder and open the *.index.html files in your browser

That's it!
